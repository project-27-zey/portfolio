    <h2>Self-decoding</h2>
    <em>Keywords: Encryption, Moving image</em><br>
    Individual work</p>

    <p>This project is a “decoding” of personal information, aiming to capture how subtle cues can open up seams for privacy breaches and self-analysis. The inspiration for the project stemmed from my thoughts on the ubiquitous sharing of information today and its impacts.</p>

    <p>I realised that inadvertently disclosed personal information in daily life could potentially reveal a lot about one’s privacy. For instance, a personal music playlist might to some extent reveal one’s personality, becoming one of the ways for others to scrutinise oneself.</p>

    <p>Simultaneously, these pieces of information closely related to daily life serve as a medium for personal self-analysis, allowing us to re-examine ourselves from perspectives we may normally overlook.</p>

    <h2>#02 Self-decoding</h2>
    Keywords: Encryption, Moving image<br>
    Individual work</p>

    <p>This project is a “decoding” of personal information, aiming to capture how subtle cues can open up seams for privacy breaches and self-analysis. The inspiration for the project stemmed from my thoughts on the ubiquitous sharing of information today and its impacts. I realised that inadvertently disclosed personal information in daily life could potentially reveal a lot about one’s privacy. For instance, a personal music playlist might to some extent reveal one’s personality, becoming one of the ways for others to scrutinise oneself. Simultaneously, these pieces of information closely related to daily life serve as a medium for personal self-analysis, allowing us to re-examine ourselves from perspectives we may normally overlook.</p>
